- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning how to write an I2P router in Go
- 📫 How to reach me: HERE! or on i2pgit.org. Usually i2pgit.org is faster. Or IRC2P. I'm eyedeekay there too.

All computers are in the process of starting I2P. Most of them don't have it installed yet. That is the first part of the process.
